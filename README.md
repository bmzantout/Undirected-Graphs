# Undirected-Graphs
A project that provides hands-on practice on the implementation of Undirected Graphs structure.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Project
## Introduction

Engaging with this project helps develop a comprehensive understanding of how to design and implement undirected graphs and find the shortest paths and cycles in such graphs. The project code is written with detailed comments throughout to facilitate easy understanding and modification.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of programming concepts and basic data structures such as trees. Additionally, you will need to have a programming environment set up with a compatible language, such as Python, C++, or Java.

### Installation

To get started with this project, you can read the tasks of the project written in the attached "Tasks.pdf" and start implementing based on the given guidelines. You can also use the text files to scan the input and check your work. [Tasks.pdf](https://github.com/bmzantout/Undirected-Graphs/files/11221501/Tasks.pdf)
